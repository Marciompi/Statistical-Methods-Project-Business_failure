## Introduction 
The objective of this study is to investigate the risk factors of business failure of Italian Companies  in the AIDA dataset.   In particular,  we address 3  business questions regarding different aspects affecting the forementioned risk that will be explained in 3 different sections.  The first two aim to categorize the distributions of different types of companies according to their status (active or failed), their age and size, whereas the last section aims to classify the status of companies using a set of pre-processed features.  The code to produce the results of the threequestions consists of a series of scripts starting with the loading of the aida.RData dataset.
